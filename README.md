# Deep Seasonal Color Analysis System (DSCAS)

## Introduction

DSCAS is a comprehensive pipeline based on classical and AI techniques for assigning a color palette to a user according to color harmony principles, given a selfie of the user. The assigned palette, together with configurable filters, is then used to retrieve compatible clothing items from a database of clothes photos which can be suggested to the user.

The project is being developed as part of the course on Computer Vision and Cognitive Systems.
