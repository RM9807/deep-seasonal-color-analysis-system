### Collaborators: [Francesco Baraldi](https://github.com/francescobaraldi), [Matteo Pagliani](https://github.com/MatteoPagliani)
A comprehensive pipeline based on classical and AI techniques for assigning a color palette to a user according to color harmony principles, given a selfie of the user. The assigned palette, together with configurable filters, is then used to retrieve compatible clothing items from a database of clothes photos which can be suggested to the user.

The project is being developed as part of the course on Computer Vision and Cognitive Systems.
